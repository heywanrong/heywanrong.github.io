# ✨ About me

Hi, there! This Wanrong (Galilean), welcome to my wonderland! Currently, I am a PhD student in computer sciences at [EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Distributed Algorithm](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/distributed-algorithms-cdt/), 
which is a fascinating place to generate future leader in data science and artificial intelligence. Before this, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering 
with the highest honor from joint education of [Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology(SIAT), University of Chinese Academy of Sciences(UCAS)](https://www.siat.ac.cn/) and 
Chongqing University of Technology (CQUT). During my undergraduate study, with the supervision of Dr.Wang Li and Dr.Shengping Liu, 
I focused on medical signal processing and electronic nose. After that, I was supervised by [Dr.Yihang Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l_O7i1oAAAAJ&hl=en), [Dr.Haifeng Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ao4Q2uAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Prof.Dong Liang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3cAJWoIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) 
to conduct MR-guided radiotherapy in prostate cancer and AI for fast MR imaging in SIAT. Now, I am supervised by [Prof.Dominik Wojtczak](https://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~dominik/), [Prof.Yalin Zheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nKCHXTAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Prof.Sven Schewe](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/computer-science/staff/sven-schewe/), 
cooperated with [Dr.Stephen Pasteris](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=mqtdKfkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and [Dr.Chris Hicks](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IMw5HFkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) from [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) to explor new AI technology in safety evaluations. I am also interested in general **AI for Medical Science**. 
In a word, I will be always looking for interesting machine learning ideas supporting with elegant theory and experiments.
